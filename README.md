**Introduction**

Hello, welcome to my blog. You can have a quick look around at my posts to get an idea of what and how I write. Enjoy your time here.



> Where the hell am I?

Greetings traveller, you've stumbled upon 10^247BoiledPotato's Blog. Here is where I post all of my silly stuff, which can range from analog chip designs to projects to stuff about gaming.

> That's cool and all, but who are you and why are you harrasing me with all these nerdy things?

Good question. I am your avarage internet nerd that for no appearant reason at all knows too much about analog computing, machine learning, gaming and programming. I also know quite a lot of stuff when it comes to physics and chemistry.

> Why do you own 10^247 boiled potatos?

yes.

> Why should I trust anything you write?

You shouldn't. I am just an over-excited amateur. My content should at most be used to introduce people to certain concepts and spark interest in people about those concepts.
